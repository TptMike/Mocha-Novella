HOW TO ADD YOUR THEME SCREENSHOT
==================================

To add your image as the theme screenshot (shown in WordPress theme selection):

1. Resize/crop your image to 1200x900 pixels (4:3 aspect ratio)
   - Your current image is 1523x1024
   - You can use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.) to resize

2. Save the image as "screenshot.png" or "screenshot.jpg"
   - PNG format is preferred for best quality

3. Place the file in this directory:
   wp-content/themes/mike-personal/

4. The file should be named exactly:
   screenshot.png
   (or screenshot.jpg)

5. After adding the file, go to WordPress Admin → Appearance → Themes
   - Your custom screenshot should appear automatically
   - You may need to refresh the page or clear cache

Note: WordPress will automatically detect and use this file as the theme preview image.
